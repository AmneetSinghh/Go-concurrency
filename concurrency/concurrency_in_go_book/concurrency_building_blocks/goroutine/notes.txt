func main(){
    hello := func(wg *sync.WaitGroup, id int) {
        wg.Add(1) // This is inside the closure
        defer wg.Done()
        fmt.Printf("Hello from %v!\n", id)
    }
    go hello()
    wg.wait() // as wait is 0, so it line executes before wg.Add(1)
}


NOTE:

* The passage warns against placing wg.Add(1) inside a closure (like the hello function). Since goroutines donâ€™t 
  run immediately, this can introduce a race condition where Wait() might execute before Add(1).
